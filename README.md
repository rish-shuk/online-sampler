# Online Sampler

This is a repo for an app where I aim to achieve the following:
* Be able to copy/paste a youtube URL or import a song into the app
* Be able to adjust the pitch of the song (similar to a vinyl pitch bender)
* Be able to snip or have a pre-existing cutting of the audio to loop
* Be able to then save that specific piece
* Bonus: Be able to add beats from a pre-existing library

This app was inspired by Tracklib's ability to create loops, however, it was limited to demo songs in the free version (I am not paying for a subscription when I can build it for free)
