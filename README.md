# Online Sampler

This is a repositry for an app where I can achieve the following:
* Be able to copy/paste a youtube URL or import a song into the app
* Be able to adjust the pitch of the song (similar to a vinyl pitch bender)
* Be able to snip or have a pre-existing cutting of the audio to loop
* Be able to then save that specific piece
* Bonus: Be able to add beats from a pre-existing library

This app was inspired by Tracklib's ability to be able to change the pitch, and loop areas however it was limited to demo songs in the free version (limited library as well)
